# Jeo-party

## Description
Play a parody of Jeopardy with a friend. <br><br>
After signing up and starting the game with your opponent,  player 1 can select a category and monetary value. To open a question on the board, click on the desired point value icon. The question is presented, and player 1 will have 60 seconds to answer the question. If they answer the question correctly, they will gain the appropriate points and the turn passes to Player 2. If player 1 answers incorrectly, they will lose points and player 2 will have a chance to answer the same question. Play continues until all the questions from the board have been selected.

## Future Implementation

With more time we plan to:
- Have a modal pop up with the question- similar to the show
- Allow more than 2 users
- Allow a choice of topics for entire game 
- The theme of the website can change with the chosen game topic
- Sessions and sockets interactions 
- Daily Double
- Double Jeopardy
- Final Jeopardy
- Allow users to play a long term game
